# In this file the desired target architectures

# The names for target architectures can be picked

# By default the 'host' architecture is built. But
# you can redefine the name of the host architecture:
# HARCH = www
#HARCH=linux-x86_64
HARCH=rhel6-x86_64

# Assuming you also want 'xxx' and 'yyy' then you'd
# add these to the 'ARCHES' variable:

# ARCHES += xxx yyy

ARCHES += buildroot-2019.08-x86_64 buildroot-2019.08-i686 buildroot-2019.08-arm


# Next, you need to define prefixes (which may include
# absolute paths) so that e.g., $(CROSS_xxx)gcc can be
# used as a C compiler e.g.,
#
# CROSS_xxx = path_to_xxx_tools/xxx-
# CROSS_yyy = path_to_yyy_tools/yyy-
#
# (you can override 'gcc' by another compiler by setting CC_<arch>)

# definitions for multiple buildroot targets

BR_HARCH=linux-x86_64

# extract version and target
BR_VERSN=$(word 2,$(subst -, ,$(TARCH)))
# map zynq->arm for buildroot
BR_TARCH=$(subst zynq,arm,$(word 3,$(subst -, ,$(TARCH))))

# cross compiler path
BR_CROSS=/afs/slac/package/linuxRT/buildroot-$(BR_VERSN)/host/$(BR_HARCH)/$(BR_TARCH)/usr/bin/$(BR_TARCH)-linux-

# map target arch-name into a make variable name
BR_ARNAMS=$(subst .,_,$(subst -,_,$(filter buildroot-%,$(ARCHES))))

# for all buildroot targets create
# CROSS_buildroot_<version>_<target>

# CPSW requires 'boost'. If this installed at a non-standard
# location (where it cannot be found automatically by the tools)
# then you need to set one of the variables
#
# boostinc_DIR_xxx,
# boostinc_DIR_default,
# boostinc_DIR,
# boost_DIR,
# boost_DIR_xxx,
# boost_DIR_default
#
# to the directory where boost headers are installed.
# In case of 'boost_DIR, boost_DIR_xxx, boost_DIR_default'
# a '/include' suffix is attached
# These aforementioned variables are tried in the listed
# order and the first one which is defined is used.
# Thus, e.g.,
#
# boostinc_DIR_xxx = /a/b/c
# boost_DIR_yyy     = /e/f
# boost_DIR_default =
#
# will use /a/b/c for architecture 'xxx' and /e/f/include for 'yyy'
# and nothing for any other one (including the 'host').
#
# Likewise, you must set
# boostlib_DIR_xxx, boostlib_DIR_default, boostlib_DIR
# (or any of boost_DIR, boost_DIR_xxx, boost_DIR_default in
# which case a '/lib' suffix is attached) if 'boost' libraries
# cannot be found automatically by the (cross) tools.
#
# Note 'boost_DIR' (& friends) must be absolute paths
# or relative to $(CPSW_DIR).
